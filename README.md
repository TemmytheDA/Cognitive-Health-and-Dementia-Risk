# Cognitive-Health-and-Dementia-Risk
**Introduction:**
This analysis aims to investigate factors associated with cognitive health and dementia risk by comparing simulated datasets for groups A (healthy individuals) and B (individuals with dementia or at risk). The study utilizes statistical analysis and visualization techniques to discern differences between the two groups and draw insights into potential interventions for promoting cognitive health.
Simulating Dataset A and B:
The data for groups A and B were simulated using various distributions and parameters. For group A, which represents healthy individuals, variables such as age, cognitive score, physical activity, diet quality, social interaction, education years, income, and smoking status were generated with parameters reflecting typical values for this population. In contrast, group B, comprising individuals with dementia or at risk, exhibited altered distributions with parameters reflecting characteristics associated with cognitive decline.

**Statistical Analysis:**
A series of statistical tests were conducted to compare the two groups across different variables. Wilcoxon rank-sum tests and t-tests were employed for continuous variables, such as age and cognitive score, to assess differences in central tendency. Chi-square tests were utilized for categorical variables, including genetic marker and smoking status, to examine associations between group membership and specific traits. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated to explore relationships between continuous variables, such as age and cognitive score, providing insights into potential dependencies.

**Visualization:**
Visualizations were created to complement the statistical analysis and facilitate interpretation of the findings. Histograms and box plots were used to compare distributions and central tendencies of continuous variables between groups A and B. Bar charts were employed to visualize the distribution of categorical variables, highlighting differences in prevalence rates between the two groups. Scatter plots and correlation heatmaps were utilized to visualize relationships between continuous variables, elucidating potential associations and trends.

**Conclusion:**
The analysis revealed significant differences between groups A and B across various factors related to cognitive health and dementia risk. Group B exhibited older age, lower cognitive scores, reduced physical activity, poorer diet quality, limited social interaction, fewer education years, lower income, and a higher prevalence of smoking compared to Group A. The findings underscore the importance of targeted interventions and lifestyle modifications to mitigate cognitive decline and dementia risk in aging populations. Personalized interventions focusing on promoting physical activity, improving diet quality, enhancing social engagement, and providing educational opportunities could be beneficial in delaying the onset or mitigating the progression of cognitive impairment.
